Methodology Notes
-----------------

-   **Six clusters of communities defined**: The researchers used
    “partitions \[of\] communities into clusters where the relationship
    between rates of homelessness and features of communities is common”
    (Introduction, p. 2), for a total of six clusters, three of which
    contain the vast majority of the communities (381 of 386). Cluster
    assignments can be found on GitHub:

    -   Cluster 1: “primarily located in the **midwest, mid-Atlantic,
        and southeast** – tend to have very low homeless rates and
        modest housing costs” (Introduction, p. 3, emphasis added)
    -   Cluster 2: “including most of **New England, Florida, the
        mountain west and central United States** – have intermediate
        homeless rates and housing costs on par with the national
        average”(Introduction, p. 3, emphasis added)
    -   Cluster 3: “span **much of the west coast and include large
        metropolitan areas on the east coast**, have very high homeless
        rates and high costs of housing.” (Introduction, p. 3, emphasis
        added)
    -   Cluster 4: one member, “El Dorado County CoC, which is unique
        because it has a high homeless rate but modest housing costs and
        low poverty rates” (p. 15)
    -   Cluster 5: three members, “the Southeast Arkansas,
        Houma-Terrebonne/Thibodaux (Louisiana), and Central Tennessee
        CoCs (see Figure 4). In these communities, the average homeless
        rate is very low (0.03%) considering the high rate of extreme
        poverty (7.96%)” (p. 15)
    -   Cluster 6: one member, “the Marin County CoC in the San
        Francisco Bay area, which stands out for its particularly strong
        association between the homeless rate and worsening housing
        affordability” (p. 15)
-   **Researchers focused on the following three features** and their
    interactions with each other:
    -   rental costs
    -   median household income
    -   percent of residents living in extreme poverty
-   **Affordability defined**: “the percent of income spent on housing
    costs – more completely reflects the relative affordability of
    housing across communities, taking into account that high rents in
    big cities are also typically supported by relatively higher
    salaries whereas lower rents in rural areas may still represent a
    significant portion of one’s income.” (Introduction, p. 3)
-   **Reasons for focus on limited features**: “While countless features
    of a community are potentially associated with homelessness –
    including apartment vacancy rates, unemployment rates, demographics,
    etc. – most (if not all) are highly correlated with the features
    that we have included in our analysis: cost of rental housing,
    median income, and rates of extreme poverty. Including many highly
    correlated predictors in a statistical model presents estimation
    problems that are avoided by focusing on a few important predictive
    features.” (Data, p. 4-5)

Findings
--------

-   **When rental costs excede 32% of median income, homelessness begins
    to increase more sharply**: “expected homeless rate in a community
    increases sharply once median rental costs exceed 32% of median
    income, providing empirical evidence for the widely used definition
    of a housing cost burden at 30% of income.” (Abstract, p. 1)
-   **Affordability is a probable cause of unequal homelessness growth
    nationally**: “The average housing affordability metric is higher in
    cluster three (38.44%) than the 32% break point we identify – which
    partly explains rapid growth in the homeless populations of many of
    these CoCs. … the majority of the United States is less sensitive to
    increases in housing costs than those 54 communities in cluster 3.
    This may explain why, despite increased homelessness in cluster 3
    cities like Los Angeles, New York, and Seattle, the nation has been
    measuring a steady net decline in homelessness since the recession
    of 2008.” (p. 18)
-   **More nuance is needed**: “prior research in this vein operated
    under the implicit assumption that pulling the same levers with the
    same strength and in the same direction will have an identical
    effect regardless of the community in question. Our findings suggest
    that such an assumption is likely to be incorrect, and that
    communities would be wise to take a more nuanced approach in how
    they contend with structural factors in seeking to reduce
    homelessness. More concretely, our identification of six clusters of
    communities based on rental costs, household income, and the rate of
    extreme poverty points to the potential need for at least six
    distinct approaches for offsetting the respective impact of these
    factors on homelessness in a community.” (p. 19)

-   “Hopper et al. (2008) provide evidence that street counts do not
    fully reflect the size of the homeless population in a community.
    This systematic undercount of homeless populations artificially
    lowers homeless rates and necessitates modeling the mechanism by
    which individuals are excluded from PIT counts.” (p. 6)
