Homelessness
------------

### Zillow

Zillow has a [data portal](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) with
downloads of various datasets available, as well as a simple dictionary.
From there, I found the following useful files:

-   [Mortgage Affordability, Rent Affordability, Price-to-Income
    Ratio](input-data/Affordability_Wide_2019Q2_Public.csv) for each
    quarter from 1979 to 2019 second quarter. May be useful as the
    latter two are considered strong predictors of homelessness.
-   [Zillow-county-to-FIPs
    crosswalk](input-data/CountyCrossWalk_Zillow.csv)
-   [Data request form](https://www.zillow.com/research/contact-us/)

Their homelessness data does not seem to be available online.

### Inside AirBnB

-   [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) has
    compiled listing and review data from AirBnB’s website. “The data
    has been analyzed, cleansed and aggregated where appropriate to
    faciliate public discussion.” Unfortunately, these data are only
    available for certain cities, can only be downloaded one city at a
    time, and each city has multiple associated files.

### HUD

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development takes Point in Time
(PIT) counts of the homeless population yearly for many Continuums of
Care (CoCs), and bi-yearly for the remainder.

### Tom Byrne

Tom Byrne has created “a geographic crosswalk between 2017 U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Continuum of Care
(CoC) boundaries and 2017 U.S. Census Bureau geographies (Census tracts
and counties),” the GitHub repo for which can be found
[here](https://github.com/tomhbyrne/HUD-CoC-Geography-Crosswalk).
