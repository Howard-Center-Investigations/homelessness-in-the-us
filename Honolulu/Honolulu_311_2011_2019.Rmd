Has there been an uptick in calls related to homelessness in comparison to other types of calls?  (utilized Honolulu edited dataset) â€“ 

- As a percentage of all calls, calls related to homelessness have not increased. 

- One interesting case is that from 2017 to 2019 there is a downward trend in the volume of all types of calls while there is an increase in calls related to homelessness. 

2011 is an outlier. It would seem data was not yet tracked for this year, or at least not comprehensively. It would be important to look further into this. 

The year with most calls (as a percentage of the whole and excluding 2011) related to homelessness is in 2012. After that the order from most to least reports is 2013, 2016, 2019 and 2018. 


 - 2011 - 1 out of 13 reports (7.69%) are categorized under homeless.  
 - 2012 - 340 out of 4221 reports (8.05%) are categorized under homeless.  
 - 2013 - 179 out of 3106 reports (5.76 %) are categorized under homeless. 
 - 2014 - 124 out of 2324 reports (3.07 %) are categorized under homeless. 
 - 2015 - 71 out of 2310 (3.07 %) observations in 2015 are filed under Report Type Homeless. 
 - 2016 - 100 out of 3182 observations (5.71 %) are filed under Report Type Homeless.Current Status of some of the reports start showing "Referred to Department". This was not the case in the prior years.   
 - 2017 - 152 out of 4231 (3.59%) observations are filed under Report Type Homeless. More "Referred to Department".   
 - 2018 - 123 out of 2840 (4.33%) observations are filed under Report Type Homeless. More "Referred to Department".  
 -2019 - 61 out of 1358 (4.49%) observations are filed under Report Type Homeless. More "Referred to Department".  
 
 
 Where are the calls coming from? 
 
 
- Interesting examples? 
- Search for any terms referring to homelessness under other terminology/ or reports filed as homelessness that are actually something else (campers for example)
are there more reports in locations experimenting gentrification (year by year)?

``` 

From the analysis above,terms that stood out were the following: 

- Homeless:  Homeless was utlized often in descriptions, it was generally categorized as "homeless" and sometimes "other". This means that when I run the analysis to map out all homeless report types, some of them might not be captured. Furthermore, some people spelled homeless (homless) wrong. 
- Urinating/feces: These terms were utlized often in the descriptions, oten in reference to homeless individuals. They were often in conjunction with other tems like  homeless and camping. Many were categorized as "other".
- Congregating: Congregating was used to describe homeless individuals, sometimes with other terms such as campers and squatters. 
- Encampment/ camping/ campsite/ campsites: Most are often categorized as "homeless". A few are categorized as "other". 
- sleeps/sleeping - Sleep and sleeping often refer to homeless individuals. They are often categorized as "homeless" and are in sentences in conjunction with women,men,woman and women. 


 
future analysis :  tokenize by two words - *** pending/ focusing on census tracts first as suggested by team.
