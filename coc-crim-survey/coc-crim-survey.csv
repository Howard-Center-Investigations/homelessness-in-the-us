Definition:    (4)    LOITER.  To delay, linger, or idle about without a lawful purpose.",,Citywide,"§ 130.06  AGGRESSIVE AND INTRUSIVE SOLICITATION.

   (A)   Findings.
      (1)   The purpose and intent of this section is to protect the safety and welfare of the general public and improve the quality of life and economic vitality of the City of Eureka by imposing reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on aggressive and intrusive solicitation while respecting the constitutional rights of free speech for all citizens.
      (2)   Aggressive and intrusive solicitation typically includes approaching or following pedestrians, the use of abusive language, unwanted physical contact, or the intentional blocking of pedestrian vehicular traffic.  The City Council finds that there has been an increase in aggressive solicitation throughout the City of Eureka and that such behavior has become disturbing and disruptive to residents and businesses.  It has also contributed to the loss of access to and enjoyment of places open to the public and has created an enhanced sense of fear, intimidation and disorder.
      (3)   The City Council finds that solicitation from people in places where they are a ""captive audience"" in which it is impossible or difficult for them to exercise their own right to decline to listen to or to avoid solicitation from others, is problematic and presents a risk to the health, safety and welfare of the public.  Such places include public transportation vehicles and their designated locations for stops, as well as gasoline stations.
      (4)   The City Council finds that solicitation on roadway median strips, at traffic intersections, and in the public roadway is unsafe and hazardous for solicitors, drivers, pedestrians and the general public.  Soliciting on roadway median strips, at traffic intersections, and in the public roadway increases the risk of drivers becoming distracted from their primary duty to watch traffic which may result in automobile accidents, congestion and blockage of streets, delay and obstruction of the free flow of travel, all of which constitute substantial traffic safety problems.
      (5)   The City Council finds that the practice of solicitation near driveways accessing shopping centers, retail, and business establishments is unsafe and hazardous for solicitors, drivers, pedestrians and the general public.  The location of the solicitor near the driveway compromises the solicitor's safety, impedes visibility, and impairs a driver's ability to safely enter and exit.  Drivers also become distracted which may result in automobile accidents, congestion and blockage of streets, delay and obstruction of the free flow of travel, all of which constitute substantial traffic safety problems.
      (6)   This law is timely and appropriate because current laws are insufficient to address the aforementioned problems.  The restrictions contained herein are neither overbroad nor vague and they are narrowly tailored to serve a substantial governmental interest.  Furthermore, in enacting this section, the City Council recognizes the availability of community service and other sentencing alternatives, which may be appropriate remedies for violations of this law.  The goal of this law is to protect citizens from the fear and intimidation accompanying certain kinds of solicitation that have become an unwelcome presence in the City of Eureka.
   (B)   Definitions.  For purposes of this section:

Section 29-15A.1 Declaration of legislative intent – Purpose.
The purpose of this ordinance is to prohibit, subject to exceptions, persons from sitting or lying on public sidewalks in areas zoned for commercial and business activities.
(a) (b) (c)
(d) (e) (f)
(g) (h)
(Added by
The council of the city and county of Honolulu finds:
Public sidewalks in areas zoned for commercial and business activities are created and maintained for the primary purposes of enabling pedestrians to safely and effectively move about from place to place, facilitating deliveries of goods and services, and providing convenient access to entertainment, goods and services.
Sitting or lying down is not the customary use of the public sidewalks. Persons who sit or lie down on public sidewalks impede and deter others from using the sidewalks; thus, they discourage residents and visitors from walking to get from place to place and accessing local shops, restaurants, and businesses, and interfere with the delivery of goods and services. The need to maintain pedestrian and commercial traffic is greatest during the hours of operation of businesses, shops, restaurants, and other commercial enterprises when public sidewalks are congested. Persons who sit or lie down on public sidewalks during business hours threaten their own safety and the safety of pedestrians, especially the elderly, disabled, vision-impaired, and children, who are put at increased risk when they must avoid and navigate around persons unexpectedly sitting or lying upon the public sidewalk.
The prohibition against sitting or lying on public sidewalks set forth in this ordinance leaves intact the individual's right to speak, protest or engage in other lawful activity on any sidewalk consistent with the individual's free speech rights. In addition, the prohibition contains exceptions for medical emergencies, and expressive activities, among others.
There are a number of places where the restrictions of this ordinance do not apply, including private property, plazas, public parks, and other common areas open to the public, that do not unduly interfere with the safe flow of pedestrian traffic, impair commercial activity, or threaten public safety.
The council acknowledges that there are reasons why one might sit or lie on a public sidewalk. The city has offered and continues to offer services to those engaged in sitting or lying on the sidewalk who appear to be in need, or to those who request service assistance. However, in many cases, these persons refuse such services or continue the conduct despite the accessibility of these services. The city will continue to invest in services for those in need and to make efforts to maintain and improve safety on public sidewalks for everyone. A law enforcement officer may not issue a citation to a person for a violation of this ordinance without first warning the person that sitting or lying down on a public sidewalk is unlawful. Present laws that prohibit the obstruction of sidewalks do not adequately address the safety hazards, disruption and deterrence to pedestrian traffic or impairment of commercial activity caused by persons sitting or lying on the public sidewalks in areas zoned for commercial and business activities.
Pedestrians are discouraged from using public sidewalks if persons are sitting or lying down on the unpaved public property immediately abutting the public sidewalk, and pedestrians often use this expanded sidewalk area as an extension of the sidewalk, to walk and move from place to place. Pedestrian traffic is impeded when persons sit or lie down on these expanded sidewalk areas, deterring persons from accessing and using the sidewalks, and discouraging persons from walking as a means of transportation.

(a) Declaration of Findings and Policy.
The city of Worcester, acting by and through its City Council, hereby makes the following
findings:
 (1) The City of Worcester has a duty to protect the rights of all people to exercise their
First Amendment rights safely. The City of Worcester has a compelling
governmental interest in imposing certain reasonable time, place and manner
regulations whenever potential First Amendment activities such as begging,
solicitation and panhandling occur on streets, highways, sidewalks, walkways,
plazas, and other public venues within the City;
(2) This ordinance is not intended to limit any persons from exercising their
constitutional right to solicit funds, picket, protest or engage in constitutionally
protected activities. The provisions of this division are expressly established to most
narrowly tailor any such restrictions to protect the First Amendment rights of all
people within the City as well as the rights of non-participating people and their
property, and to ensure the rights and safety of all people and/or property to the
extent possible;

(3) Persons approached by individuals asking for money, objects or other things of any
value are particularly vulnerable to real, apparent or perceived coercion when such
request is accompanied by or immediately followed or preceded with aggressive
behavior such as:
(A) continuing to beg or solicit from a person after the person has given a negative
response to such solicitation;
(B) touching another person or their property in the course of begging or soliciting
without that person's consent;
(C) blocking or interfering with the safe or free passage of a pedestrian or vehicle by
any means;
(D) using violent or threatening gestures which are likely to provoke an immediate
violent reaction from the person who is the subject of the solicitation or request for
money;
(E) closely following behind, ahead or alongside a person who has been solicited or
asked for money after that person has given a negative response to such solicitation; 
173
(F) using profane, threatening, or abusive language, either during the solicitation or
begging or following a refusal;
(G) begging or soliciting money from anyone who is waiting in line for tickets,
entering a public building or riding on public transportation;
(H) begging or soliciting in a manner with conduct, words or gestures intended or
likely to cause a reasonable person to fear imminent bodily harm, danger or damage
to or loss of property or otherwise to be intimidated into giving money or any other
thing of value; or
(I) begging or soliciting in a group of two or more persons in an intimidating fashion.
(4) The City desires to respect a person's potential right to solicit, beg or panhandle
while simultaneously protecting another's right to not be unduly coerced.
(5) The City further finds that aggressive soliciting, begging or panhandling of persons
within 20 feet of any outdoor seating area of any cafe, restaurant or other business,
bank, automated teller machine, automated teller machine facility, check cashing
business, mass transportation facility, mass transportation stop, or pay telephone also
subjects people being solicited to improper and undue influence and/or fear and
should not be allowed.
(6) Persons approaching other individuals in an aggressive manner asking for money,
objects or other things of any value after dark in public places inspire alarm and fear,
which coupled with the inherent difficulty of establishing identity should not be
allowed.
(b) Purpose and Intent.
The public purpose of this ordinance is to protect the rights of all peoples to exercise
their First Amendment rights as well as the people and/or property of those who chose to be
non-participating.

(1) It is unlawful for any person to loiter or prowl in a place, at a time or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals, under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity.
(2) Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such alarm or immediate concern is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon appearance of a law enforcement officer, refuses to identify himself or herself, or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object. Unless flight by the person or other circumstance makes it impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or immediate concern which would otherwise be warranted by requesting the person to identify himself or herself and explain his or her presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this section if the law enforcement officer did not comply with this procedure or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person is true and, if believed by the officer at the time, would have dispelled the alarm or immediate concern.
(3) Any person violating the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083.

(1) Except when leased as provided in s. 337.25(5) or otherwise authorized by the rules of the department, it is unlawful to make any use of the right-of-way of any state transportation facility, including appendages thereto, outside of an incorporated municipality in any manner that interferes with the safe and efficient movement of people and property from place to place on the transportation facility. Failure to prohibit the use of right-of-way in this manner will endanger the health, safety, and general welfare of the public by causing distractions to motorists, unsafe pedestrian movement within travel lanes, sudden stoppage or slowdown of traffic, rapid lane changing and other dangerous traffic movement, increased vehicular accidents, and motorist injuries and fatalities. Such prohibited uses include, but are not limited to, the free distribution or sale, or display or solicitation for free distribution or sale, of any merchandise, goods, property or services; the solicitation for charitable purposes; the servicing or repairing of any vehicle, except the rendering of emergency service; the storage of vehicles being serviced or repaired on abutting property or elsewhere; and the display of advertising of any sort, except that any portion of a state transportation facility may be used for an art festival, parade, fair, or other special event if permitted by the appropriate local governmental entity. Local government entities may issue permits of limited duration for the temporary use of the right-of-way of a state transportation facility for any of these prohibited uses if it is determined that the use will not interfere with the safe and efficient movement of traffic and the use will cause no danger to the public. The permitting authority granted in this subsection shall be exercised by the municipality within incorporated municipalities and by the county outside an incorporated municipality. Before a road on the State Highway System may be temporarily closed for a special event, the local governmental entity which permits the special event to take place must determine that the temporary closure of the road is necessary and must obtain the prior written approval for the temporary road closure from the department. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize such activities on any limited access highway. Local governmental entities may, within their respective jurisdictions, initiate enforcement action by the appropriate code enforcement authority or law enforcement authority for a violation of this section.",https://m.flsenate.gov/Statutes/316.130,None,,,None,,,Citywide,"856.011 Disorderly intoxication.—
(1) No person in the state shall be intoxicated and endanger the safety of another person or property, and no person in the state shall be intoxicated or drink any alcoholic beverage in a public place or in or upon any public conveyance and cause a public disturbance.
(2) Any person violating the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083.
(3) Any person who shall have been convicted or have forfeited collateral under the provisions of subsection (1) three times in the preceding 12 months shall be deemed a habitual offender and may be committed by the court to an appropriate treatment resource for a period of not more than 60 days. Any peace officer, in lieu of incarcerating an intoxicated person for violation of subsection (1), may take or send the intoxicated person to her or his home or to a public or private health facility, and the law enforcement officer may take reasonable measures to ascertain the commercial transportation used for such purposes is paid for by such person in advance. Any law enforcement officers so acting shall be considered as carrying out their official duty.

Section 8. Any person who is incapacitated may be assisted by a police officer with or without his consent to his residence, to a facility or to a police station. To determine for purposes of this chapter only, whether or not such person is intoxicated, the police officer may request the person to submit to reasonable tests of coordination, coherency of speech, and breath.

Any person assisted by a police officer to a police station shall have the right, and be informed in writing of said right, to request and be administered a breathalyzer test. Any person who is administered a breathalyzer test shall be presumed intoxicated if evidence from said test indicates that the percentage of alcohol in his blood is ten one hundredths or more and shall be placed in protective custody at a police station or transferred to a facility. Any person who is administered a breathalyzer test, under this section, shall be presumed not to be intoxicated if evidence from said test indicates that the percentage of alcohol in his blood is five one hundredths or less and shall be released from custody forthwith. If any person who is administered a breathalyzer test, under this section, and evidence from said test indicates that the percentage of alcohol in his blood is more than five one hundredths and is less than ten one hundredths there shall be no presumption made based solely on the breathalyzer test. In such instance a reasonable test of coordination or speech coherency must be administered to determine if said person is intoxicated. Only when such test of coordination or speech coherency indicates said person is intoxicated shall he be placed in protective custody at a police station or transferred to a facility.

Any person presumed intoxicated and to be held in protective custody at a police station shall, immediately after such presumption, have the right and be informed of said right to make one phone call at his own expense and on his own behalf. Any person assisted by a police officer to a facility under this section shall have the right to make one phone call at his own expense on his own behalf and shall be informed forthwith upon arriving at the facility of said right. The parent or guardian of any person, under the age of eighteen, to be held in protective custody at a police station shall be notified forthwith upon his arrival at said station or as soon as possible thereafter.

If any incapacitated person is assisted to a police station, the officer in charge or his designee shall notify forthwith the nearest facility that the person is being held in protective custody. If suitable treatment services are available at a facility, the department shall thereupon arrange for the transportation of the person to the facility in accordance with the provisions of section seven.

No person assisted to a police station pursuant to this section shall be held in protective custody against his will; provided, however, that if suitable treatment at a facility is not available, an incapacitated person may be held in protective custody at a police station until he is no longer incapacitated or for a period of not longer than twelve hours, whichever is shorter.

A police officer acting in accordance with the provisions of this section may use such force as is reasonably necessary to carry out his authorized responsibilities. If the police officer reasonably believes that his safety or the safety of other persons present so requires, he may search such person and his immediate surroundings, but only to the extent necessary to discover and seize any dangerous weapons which may on that occasion be used against the officer or other person present; provided, however, that if such person is held in protective custody at a police station all valuables and all articles which may pose a danger to such person or to others may be taken from him for safekeeping and if so taken shall be inventoried.

A person assisted to a facility or held in protective custody by the police pursuant to the provisions of this section, shall not be considered to have been arrested or to have been charged with any crime. An entry of custody shall be made indicating the date, time, place of custody, the name of the assisting officer, the name of the officer in charge, whether the person held in custody exercised his right to make a phone call, whether the person held in custody exercised his right to take a breathalyzer test, and the results of the breathalyzer test if taken, which entry shall not be treated for any purposes, as an arrest or criminal record.",https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIV/TitleI/Chapter266/Section123 AND https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIV/TitleI/Chapter272/Section66 AND https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIV/TitleI/Chapter272/Section53 AND https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXVI/Chapter111B/Section8
